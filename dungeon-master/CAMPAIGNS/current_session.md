## Session 1
- **Party:** Kriv (Blue Dragonborn Paladin), Elara (Half-Elf Bard NPC)
- **Events:** Kriv arrived at Oakhaven. Spotted a hooded figure in the alleyway near *The Golden Tankard*. Kriv ignored the figure and entered the tavern. Kriv approached a group of farmers to join their card game. Kriv won the card game (Roll: 18) and learned about the Old Keep. Kriv questioned the farmers: learned the Keep is on Black Hill, has green fire at night, and a party of four vanished there a week ago. Kriv spoke to Elara the Bard and learned the Keep was the seat of Baron Morvath, a necromancer, and the green fire indicates his seal is broken. Kriv asked about the hooded figure; Elara identified him as Thorne, a Gravekeeper who knows the paths to the Keep. Kriv told Elara he would consider her offer, then rented a room (10cp) and rested for the night. Kriv found Elara in the common room the next morning. Kriv recruited Elara. Together they went to the cemetery to find Thorne. Kriv used Divine Sense on Thorne (Result: Human, but tainted by necromancy). Kriv persuaded Thorne (Roll: 17) to help. Thorne gave Kriv a key to the "Servant's Path" and revealed he buried one of the missing adventurers last night. Kriv swapped equipment to Longsword and Shield. Kriv prayed at the rogue's grave, gaining Inspiration and spotting a dropped journal. Kriv showed the journal to Thorne, who refused to touch it but advised reading it. Elara read the journal: warned of poison traps in the cellar and auditory hallucinations. Kriv used Divine Sense on the journal (Result: Safe). Kriv decided to rest and prepare. Paid 10cp for room. Kriv and Elara traveled to the Old Keep, located the Servant's Path, and entered the Wine Cellar. Kriv investigated the barrels (Roll: 14) and found a Potion of Healing. Kriv gave the potion to Elara and listened at the door (Roll: 15). Kriv kicked open the door (Surprise Round). Elara cast Vicious Mockery on Skeleton 1. Kriv attacked Skeleton 2 (Roll: 18, Damage: 7). Elara finished off Skeleton 2. Kriv destroyed the remaining skeleton (Roll: 20, Damage: 10). Kriv looted the skeleton (Found: 12sp, Silver Ring). Elara played a tune to lift spirits. Kriv identified the ring (Necrotic Resistance), prayed for the skeletons, and listened at the Great Hall doors (heard nothing). Kriv equipped the ring. Elara checked the doors for traps (Roll: 18, Safe). Elara picked the lock (Roll: 21). Kriv used Divine Sense: Detected 6 lesser undead and 1 powerful undead in the Great Hall. Kriv and Elara formulated a bottleneck strategy. Executed breach: Kriv used Breath Weapon (7 dmg), Elara used Thunderwave (13 dmg). Destroyed 3 Skeletons, damaged Wight. Retreated to bottleneck.
