# AP Plan for High School

## Input Collection

**Timeline:** Currently nearing end of 8th grade, starting high school in August

**Academic Background:** 
- 4.0 GPA in all classes
- Skipped two **MATH** grades
- Algebra Honors completed
- Currently taking Geometry Honors

**Interests:** Anything and Everything

**Summer Plans:** Wants to use summers as efficiently as possible (3 summers available before graduation)

**Prerequisites:** Not yet completed

**Workload:** 2-3 AP classes per year target

**School Resources:** Troy School District offers AP directly

## Analysis & Recommendations

**Your Strengths:**
- Exceptional academic record (4.0 GPA, grade acceleration)
- Strong math foundation (Algebra Honors → Geometry Honors)
- Broad intellectual interests
- Committed to summer enrichment
- Access to direct AP courses at TSD

**Strategy:**
Given you're entering 9th grade in August, you have 4 years of high school. With 3 summers + regular school years, you can strategically build prerequisites and take 17-19 AP courses total by graduation.

## Proposed AP Schedule

### **Freshman Year (9th Grade) - 2024-2025**
*Focus: Build prerequisites for science and math APs*

**Regular School Year:**
- AP Computer Science Principles (or Intro to Programming)
- Algebra 2 (prerequisite for Calculus)
- Biology (prerequisite for AP Bio)

**Summer 2025 (after freshman year):**
- AP Chemistry (online/summer program) - gets you ahead on science

**Total: 3 APs**

### **Sophomore Year (10th Grade) - 2025-2026**
*Expand into STEM while building humanities foundation*

**Regular School Year:**
- AP Chemistry (if not done in summer)
- AP World History or AP European History
- Pre-Calculus or Honors Precalc

**Summer 2026 (after sophomore year):**
- AP Calculus AB (online/summer program) - complete during summer
- AP US History (online prep)

**Total: 4-5 APs**

### **Junior Year (11th Grade) - 2026-2027**
*Peak AP year - take most of your APs*

**Regular School Year:**
- AP Calculus BC
- AP Biology
- AP US History
- AP English Language & Composition

**Summer 2027 (after junior year):**
- AP Physics 1 or C Mechanics
- AP Microeconomics or Macroeconomics

**Total: 6 APs**

### **Senior Year (12th Grade) - 2027-2028**
*Diverse APs and specialization*

**Regular School Year:**
- AP Physics 2 or C E&M
- AP English Literature & Composition
- AP Statistics
- AP Government & Politics (US)

**Optional additional APs:**
- AP Art History
- AP Psychology
- AP Human Geography
- AP Computer Science A (if interested in deeper CS)

**Total: 4-8 APs**

## Timeline Summary

| Year | Regular APs | Summer APs | Total |
|------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Freshman | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| Sophomore | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| Junior | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| Senior | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| **TOTAL** | **14** | **5** | **19** |

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Workload Reality Check:**
- Freshman/Sophomore: Manageable (2-3 APs per year allows you to adjust)
- Junior: Intensive but doable (4 APs + summer = 6 total)
- Senior: Balanced (4 APs without summer stress)
- This assumes strong time management and commitment

**Contingency Plans:**
- If overwhelmed in Freshman year, delay summer AP Chemistry to Sophomore summer
- Focus quality over quantity - maintaining high scores (4-5 range) is better than many lower scores
- Monitor your stress levels; school counselors should be consulted

**Next Steps:**
1. Confirm which specific AP courses TSD offers in each year
2. Research summer AP programs (online, community college, etc.)
3. Plan with your school counselor to ensure course prerequisites align
4. Set up regular check-ins to assess progress and adjust as needed

## Action Items (Priority Order)

- [ ] Meet with TSD high school counselor before August to discuss AP pathway
- [ ] Finish strong in Geometry Honors (spring of 8th grade)
- [ ] Enroll in rigorous freshman schedule starting August
- [ ] Research summer AP Chemistry program options for summer 2025
- [ ] Monitor grades and adjust if needed after freshman fall semester
